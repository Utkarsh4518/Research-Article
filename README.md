This repository implements the U-Transfer Reinforced Gaussian Network (U-TRGN) for epilepsy detection from EEG signals, as published in *Artificial Intelligence and Applications* (DOI: 10.47852/bonviewAIA32021848).

## Key Features
- **Novel U-TRGN Model**: Combines U-Net feature extraction with reinforcement learning
- **High Accuracy**: 97.04% accuracy, 99.56% AUC-ROC (on UCI Epilepsy Dataset)
- **Clinical Interpretability**: Visualizations for model decisions

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Utkarsh4518/Research-Article.git
cd Research-Article
pip install -r requirements.txt
